# text-Encrypter
This is a standalone application I started to make just to have fun encrypting text files. There are three views, Rot13, RotAny, and RotByWord. 

Rot13 rotates a String by 13 characters

RotAny rotates a String by user's choice, also allows for an additional Integer for an extra level of encryption

RotByWord rotates a String by using another String as a key, also allows for two additonal Integers for added levels of encryption
